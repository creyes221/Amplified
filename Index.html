	<p id="intro"><span id="leadin">The invention of the vacuum tube</span> created an electronics revolution that spawned new technology like radios and early computers. During the dawn of the electric guitar, musicians used vacuum tubes in guitar amplifiers, allowing early guitarists to create a gold standard for how electric guitars should sound. In the '50s, new transistor technology allowed for smaller, cheaper electronics to replace old tube-based systems in almost all arenas - except for guitar amps. These so-called "solid state" amps produce a different sound and offer different benefits from their tube-based predecessors. Even today, guitarists are left with the decision to either adopt the more advanced technology or stick with the traditional amps of the golden age of guitars.</p>

      <p><span id="tleadin">One of the primary</span> reasons modern guitarists still value tube amplifiers is that the sound is slightly more colorful than the solid state sound. Audio engineer and SUNY Oneonta lecturer Brett Masteller says this is because the tube technology emphasizes certain sounds.</p>
      
      <p>"Essentially the tube helps warm up specific sounds and adds a type of distortion to the sound. Not distortion in the sense that everything's fuzzed out like distorted guitar, but more about emphasizing different parts of the harmonics," Masteller says. "Solid state is a bit more transparent and clean, so it doesn't do this type of coloration to the sound."</p>
      
      <p>Since tube adds that coloration, it gives an engineer more opportunities to add effects to the sound. Masteller says that because of this he prefers to use tube amps when recording rock or pop music in the studio. </p>
      
      <p>"It depends on my preference but also on the preference of the performer, what kind of sound they're looking for," Masteller says. "In the classical world, it's all about capturing the performance. But in the studio world, there's pop and rock, and people generally want magic tricks."</p>

    <p><span id="ssleadin">Solid state's strength</span> lies in the fact that it more accurately reproduces the sound that goes into it. This makes it more useful for music genres where the focus is on the strength of the performance itself. Masteller says he uses solid state amps when recording classical and chamber music. Heith Jensen, owner of Rock N Roll Vintage guitar shop in Chicago, says this makes solid state amps popular with jazz performers as well.</p>
    
    <p>"Jazz guys like a really flat, non-colored tone," Jensen says. "Solid states are really good for that because they don't really enhance the sound. Whatever the sound that's going into them is the sound that's going to be coming out of them. It's not colored or beautified in any way."
</p>

    <p>But the dynamic between tube and solid state amps isn't as simple as one sounds clean and one sounds fuzzy. Andris Balins, co-owner of Dryhill Studios in Oneonta, N.Y., says he chooses amps based on their headroom &ndash; how loud an amp can get without going into distortion &ndash; rather than their specific technology. Solid state sounds clean, but it can also get a really distorted sound after being pushed past its headroom. </p>
    
    <p>"There's not necessarily a ton of differences between the two until you push them into distortion," Balins says. "I use solid state sometimes to get grungy, in-your-face distortion. It's able to push really far and stay pretty clear."</p>

    <p><span id="ssleadin">The move to</span> solid state technology gave amps a boost in durability. Replacing glass tubes with small, metal chips allowed amps to last longer with less maintenance.</p>
    
    <p>"[Solid state amps] are pretty indestructible," Jensen says. "It's much more reliable technology."</p>
    
    <p>"I have old transistor tech that has been lying dormant for years but works just as well as the day I turned it on," Masteller says. "I have an older Fender guitar amp that was a tube-based amp, and that thing just required more maintenance. If I left it dormant for a while, it didn't sound good."</p>
    
    <p>Solid state technology also removed the need to worry about short-term amp maintenance in the moments before a performance. Vacuum tubes need time to warm up in order to produce the rich sound that many guitarists value. But letting a tube amp warm up for too long can cause issues as well.
</p>

<p>"If these things are neglected, they won't work as well," Masteller says. "If you leave something on for way too long and the tubes get so hot they're destroying themselves, then that's not a good thing. But you want them to be somewhat warm so you can color the sound. It's a balancing act."</p>

      <p><span id="tleadin">No matter what</span> type of technology an amp runs on, however, it's still liable to failure. Pushing an amp's volume to the edges its limits for extended periods of time can result in a blown amp of either type. And when an amp breaks, older tube technology reveals a unique advantage.</p>
      
      <p>"As far as when they blow up, which is what happens to either ... [a solid state amp] blows a bunch of shit up, and it tends to blow a side up." says Brad Boughton, amp technician at Third Coast Guitar Repair in Chicago. "One side of the solid state stuff will completely fail. Whereas on a tube amp, maybe it's a short tube. Maybe it's a shorted resistor. It's usually one part that goes bad instead of a lot of parts. And that's what actually makes it easier to repair the older analog stuff, because you're not just a part changer. Instead of, like, 50 parts going bad, you've got two."</p>
      
      <p>Boughton adds that the older circuitry of tube amps is more accessible than the circuitry found in newer models, which can make the process of figuring out the problem with a broken solid state amp more involved.</p>
      
      <p>"[Solid state technology is] harder to fix when it breaks because it's run off a circuit board, and there's not many people that work with circuit board stuff," Jensen says. "And that circuit board stuff is dated circuit board technology. So it's not something that a young technician is going to have spent time learning."</p>
      
      <p>"[With tubes], it's easier to analyze and find out what's wrong," Boughton agrees. "Whereas with solid state stuff, I've spent days, weeks, months just scratching my head because it's harder to observe and control."</p>

	<p><span id="tleadin">The dispute between</span> amps is driven in some fashion by industry pressure to adhere to an old standard. While solid state amps provide functional and cheap sound for a young band, there is a sense of graduation when musicians switch to tube amps. <p>
	<p>"Anybody that's any sort of professional, 98% of them will use a tube," Jensen says. "And the reason for that is a tube amplifier is musical sounding."</p>
	<p>"With a solid state amp, you'll just get the note and, you know, if you look down at the graph, it'll just be a flat line. It'll just be a note. With a tube, it'll go up and get complex and then fade out, and it fades out on a softer form, too."</p>

				<p><span id="ssleadin">Meanwhile, solid state </span>amps cost less and weigh less, making them an obvious choice for aspiring musicians who need to lug their own equipment for shows and who have not quite seen the money that comes with fame. Balins describes a solid state amp made in Japan that serves as an ideal option for beginners.</p>
		<p>"They're extremely light. You can pick one up with one finger," Balins says. "They're loaded with a 4- or 6-inch speaker, so not really that big."</p>
		<p>Solid state amps can start from $50 for the basic model, but the lowest-priced tube amp will run a rockstar more than $400, Jensen says. The cost for slight change in sound and much more cumbersome piece of equipment may be prohibitive for an aspiring musician, especially for those not planning on making a living out of music.</p>
		<p>"[Solid state amps] serve a purpose," Boughton says. "It's one of those things where a lot of those players, they're nine-to-fiver lawyers, and they're just coming home to vent some steam. So they just want an amp that does it all, that's got all the effects built into it, so they're not buying 20 pedals. It's all right there."</p>
